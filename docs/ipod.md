# iPod audit and device checks

Normal and iPod share one navigation payload. `--ipod` enables the compact layout
payload helpers and build-time edits in `tools/compact.py`; normal receives no
compact executable sites or UI assets. `patch/compact.json` records the original
asset hashes and full MIPS instructions. The builder also pins the complete stock
ZIP and executable, rejects mismatches, and records every changed asset/site.

AWTK binary UI files contain a four-byte magic, recursive widgets with a 32-byte
type and four signed geometry fields, NUL-separated properties and child/end
markers. Decode/encode must round-trip exactly before editing. Only nine named
local browsing assets are accepted. The primary `view_navbar` stays allocated but invisible
and disabled, including dynamically recreated children. Separate action bars are
moved into its space. The global status bar is outside these assets.

`PITCH = 72` is shared by all build-time row geometry edits, native row-height
resets and artwork offset divisors. Four rows fit the 290-pixel client area below
the status bar, so `BOTTOM = 290` replaces the stock lists' 260-pixel content
bottom. Row bodies are `PITCH - 4` pixels, and the stock 52-pixel artwork is
drawn at natural size (`ART = 52`) with `ART_INSET = 8` on all four sides: the
artwork never rescales, so glyphs and covers stay as sharp as stock, and the row
layout's eight-pixel left margin seats the artwork exactly. ART_INSET also
positions the playing overlay. Font/style definitions are untouched. Full-height
text/icon containers are shortened with their button. Titles and metadata keep
their stock centring, one pixel higher for the two-pixel-shorter body.

Native local row-pool constructors are at 0x523038 (folder), 0x4aa2cc (songs),
0x4b0efc (local categories) and 0x4a4ae8 (album list/grid). The album grid branch
is unchanged. Album detail, artist track and playlist constructors have their own
explicit sites in the audit. Folder reset at 0x5217d4, return offset division at
0x521a84 and scrolling cover division at 0x5228f8 all use the same compact pitch.
The category cover callback originally divides by 120 despite using 78-pixel
rows; iPod corrects its audited divisor at 0x4b0608 to 72. Rebinding and delayed
cover callbacks keep the same widget geometry and saved cover preferences.

Seven audited row-constructor calls install a per-instance children layouter for
folder, song, album-list, category, album-track, artist-track and playlist rows.
Before the stock horizontal layout runs, it gives the title (and its containing
view, where present) the row width minus the existing side margins, visible sibling
widths and gaps. Hidden artwork and controls reserve no space. The stock layouter
still positions the children, preserving the title's left edge, artwork, row height
and padding. Its clone/destruction and parameter functions remain native; neither
the shared widget implementation nor album grids are hooked. The folder rebind's
140/190-pixel resize call is disabled so recycled titles retain their computed
width. Title styles and scrolling/ellipsis settings are untouched.

The stock long-key function at 0x4e873c retains all instructions except the final
Home call at 0x4e8924. Stock power, lock, test and key-lock gates and its release
latch execute first. iPod cancels centre confirmation and spin state, checks
the shared screen/navigation restrictions, and then either calls the stock Home
destination when Now Playing is already the top window, or calls the stock switch
function with `playing_page` and `{0, 0, 0xff, 2}`. The `0xff` context skips
player_start, so playback is not restarted. The switch keeps the hold's key-up
from reaching the stock release filter, which would leave the latch that filter
shares armed and swallow the next Return, so the payload clears that latch once
the switch has landed. The hold's release therefore leaves the unit on Now
Playing and the first short Return reaches the stock Back path, with position
memory restoring the browsing page and its selection. No short-Return callback or
other long-key destination changes.

## Device checklist

Every check below has been hardware-tested on both builds and confirmed by the
user. Their parameters remain unchanged; the list stays as the regression guide.

- **pull to search**: iPod Local Songs only: start at the list top, pull
  47/48/49 pixels and release. Check both prompts, backing below the threshold,
  horizontal swipes, ordinary taps, mid-list starts and empty lists. No row should
  open after a claimed pull. Close search and confirm the same category/tab context.
  Folder view must not respond. Interrupt a pull with wheel, buttons, navigation or
  screen-off; the prompt must disappear without opening search. A pull starting at
  screen y=30 belongs to quick settings; y=31 inside the list may start search.
  Wheel end wrapping stays unchanged. Normal keeps its stock search toolbar.

- **readability**: Browse Folder and Local Songs, artists, genres, albums, album
  tracks, artist tracks/albums and playlists. Check all four complete ordinary
  rows, long filenames, two-line metadata, non-Latin text and the selection
  outline. Titles should use the formerly empty right-hand space up to the row's
  padding or visible trailing control, without overlap. Repeat after scrolling,
  page reopening and artwork/control visibility changes; short titles should stay
  at the same left position and overflowing titles should still scroll/ellipsize.
  Touch and centre must activate the same item at every row and edge.
- **toolbar**: iPod hides the entire primary toolbar (including Home,
  search/multi-select and Now Playing icons), keeps the status bar, and reclaims
  its space after page recreation and nested folder returns. Normal stays stock.
- **artwork**: Toggle folder icons/covers off/on, restart to verify saved settings,
  and try missing covers, square/non-square art, fast scrolling and recycled rows.
  Check late-arriving covers, the even inset and sharpness around artwork, alignment, no overlap
  and correct artwork indexing after child/grandchild returns. Test both saved
  album display modes.
- **return**: Short Return traverses folders and other pages as stock. Hold Return
  from browsing and release: iPod opens Now Playing without restarting audio
  and stays there; the next short Return goes back to the same page, selection and
  scroll position. Hold Return while already on Now Playing: the stock Home
  shortcut runs. Normal opens Home as before. Repeat holds and visits, try already
  playing and an empty playback queue, and confirm the next short Return still
  works after each visit. Arm centre confirmation then hold Return; no delayed
  item should open. Repeat screen-off, locked, power-off/USB/BT restrictions and
  modal-blocked navigation. Other long keys must remain stock.
- **scrollbar**: Turn the wheel in Folder, Local Songs and a long settings list.
  Confirm the player's own right-edge scrollbar appears as the list moves, tracks
  the position and fades on its own; check lists without a native bar stay
  unchanged. Touch-scroll and then turn the wheel to confirm the handoff, and
  leave a wheel-scrolled page to confirm no bar or timer returns on the next
  screen.
- **retained_controls**: Use tabs, Play All, sorting, playlist import/export,
  rename/delete and all separately retained action/editing controls. Verify
  remembered selection after sorting and folder/album/query returns.
- **excluded_screens**: Verify home carousel, Now Playing, settings, online
  services, dialogs and scanning/editing screens retain stock layouts and work.

Emulator tests validate native constructors, stock input gates and the shared
navigation behavior with mocked toolkit services. They do not establish visual
readability, actual touch hit-testing, rendering or playback behavior on hardware.
